# seleniumlogintests
This project contains the code for automated e2e browser testing using Selenium Webdriver and Java.
The framework is based on Page Object Model concept. 
There are three packages: drivers(where an instance for a driver is created), 
Pages (actual object reporsitory for the web elements available in the application under test), and
Tests(Test cases executable).
Installations needed:
Java JDK
Maven (usually I use Gradle, but Maven was installed on my old laptop))
Git
IntelliJ IDE
